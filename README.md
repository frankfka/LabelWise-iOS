# LabelWise - iOS

LabelWise allows you to easily visualize nutrition and ingredient labels. Take a photo of any Canadian/US nutritional label to analyze the food's nutrient breakdown. Labelwise also allows you to gain insights into the ingredients of your food, highlighting any potentially harmful additives. An demo video of the app can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDCk7Qt6Tj0).

The app was built with the newly released SwiftUI framework. It relies heavily on SwiftUI and Combine for state management, as all the ViewModels are built to be reactive using `ObservableObject`.
